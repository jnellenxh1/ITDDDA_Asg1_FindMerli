  - Ahoy there! Welcome to Fort Siloso. This place is a treasure trove of Singapore's
    military history!
  - Built in the late 19th century, Siloso was one of the 12 coastal batteries that
    formed the "Fortress Singapore" defense line.
  - Its main job was to protect the western entrance to Singapore's port and the
    naval base. It was armed with powerful guns ready to fire at enemy ships.
  - But the most pivotal moment for the Fort was during World War II in 1942, when
    the Japanese attacked.
  - The guns here were designed to fire out to sea, but when the Japanese invaded
    from the land, the Fort's defenses had to be rapidly turned inwards to face the
    jungle!
  - "After the war, Fort Siloso was preserved and later opened as a military museum.
    It\u2019s the only coastal fort in Singapore still standing today!"
